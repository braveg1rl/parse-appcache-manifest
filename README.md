Parses HTML5 application cache manifest.

## Usage

```javascript
parseManifest = require("parse-appcache-manifest")
entries = parseManifest(manifest)
```

`entries` will be an object with three properties: `cache`, `network`, `fallback`. 

`cache` and `network` are both arrays which contain entries. 

`fallback` is an object with the url (or url pattern) as key, and the fallback url as value.
